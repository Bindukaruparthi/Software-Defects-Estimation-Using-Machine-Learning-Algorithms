# Software-Defects-Estimation
Software Defect Estimation using Machine Learning predicts defect-prone software modules using metrics like LOC, complexity, and Halstead values. The project applies ML algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression to improve software quality, reduce testing effort, and support early risk detection.
